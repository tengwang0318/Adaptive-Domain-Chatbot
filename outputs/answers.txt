    • Identifying any localizing symptoms (eg, headache, cough): These symptoms help narrow the range of
possible causes. The localizing symptom may be part of the patient's chief complaint or identified only
by specific questioning.
• Determining whether the patient is seriously or chronically ill (particularly if such illness is unrecognized):
Many causes of fever in healthy people are self-limited, and many of the possible viral infections are
difficult to diagnose specifically. Limiting testing to the seriously or chronically ill can help avoid many
expensive, unnecessary, and often fruitless searches.
History: History of present illness
 should cover magnitude and duration of fever and method used to

be identified.
Review of systems
 should identify symptoms of chronic illness, including recurrent fevers, night
sweats, and weight loss.
Past medical history
 should particularly cover the following:
• Recent surgery
• Known disorders that predispose to infection (eg, HIV infection, diabetes, cancer, organ transplantation,
sickle cell disease, valvular heart disorders—particularly if an artificial valve is present)
• Other known disorders that predispose to fever (eg, rheumatologic disorders, SLE, gout, sarcoidosis,
hyperthyroidism, cancer)
Questions to ask about recent travel include location, time since return, locale (eg, in back country, only in
cities), vaccinations received before travel, and any use of prophylactic antimalarial drugs (if required).

made by recognizing disease patterns, and testing and treatment are initiated based on customary
practice. For example, during a flu epidemic, a healthy adult who has had fever, aches, and harsh cough
for 2 days is likely to be recognized as another case of influenza and provided only appropriate
symptomatic relief. Such pattern recognition is efficient and easy to use but may be subject to error
because other diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities are not seriously or systematically considered. For
example, a patient with that flu pattern and decreased O

pneumonia and require antibiotics. In more complex cases, a structured, quantitative, analytical

Influenza viruses may be spread by airborne droplets, person-to-person contact, or contact with
contaminated items. Airborne spread appears to be the most important mechanism.
At-risk groups:
 Certain patients are at high risk of complications from influenza:
• Children < 4 yr
• Adults > 65 yr
• People with chronic medical disorders (eg, cardiopulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, renal or hepatic
insufficiency, hemoglobinopathies, immuodeficiency)
• Women in the 2nd or 3rd trimester of pregnancy
• Patients with disorders that impair handling of respiratory secretions (eg, cognitive dysfunction,The Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition
Chapter 150. Respiratory Viruses
1562

All patients should be asked about possible exposures (eg, via unsafe food or water, insect bites, animal
contact, or unprotected sex).
Vaccination history, particularly against hepatitis A and B and against organisms that cause meningitis,
influenza, or pneumococcal infection, should be noted.
Drug history should include specific questions about the following:
• Drugs known to cause fever (see
Table 129-1
)
• Drugs that predispose to infection (eg, corticosteroids, anti-TNF drugs, chemotherapeutic and
antirejection drugs, other immunosuppressants)
• Illicit use of injection drugs (predisposing to endocarditis, hepatitis, septic pulmonary emboli, and skin
and soft-tissue infections)
Physical examination:
 Physical examination begins with confirmation of fever. Fever is most accurately

acquired very rarely by contact with infected pigs.
In June 2009, the World Health Organization declared H1N1 swine flu a pandemic; it has spread to > 70
countries and to all 50 US states. The majority of the deaths occurred in Mexico. The attack rate and
mortality for H1N1 swine flu are higher in young and middle-aged adults and lower in the elderly than they
are for seasonal flu. The pandemic entered the post-pandemic period in August 2010.
Symptoms and Signs
Symptoms, signs, and complications resemble those of ordinary influenza (see p.
1406
), although
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may be more common. Symptoms are usually mild, but they can become
severe, leading to pneumonia or respiratory failure.
Diagnosis
• Sometimes PCR testing of respiratory samples

Introduction
Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic BP (≥ 140 mm Hg), diastolic BP (≥ 90 mm
Hg), or both. Hypertension with no known cause (primary; formerly, essential hypertension) is
most common. Hypertension with an identified cause (secondary hypertension) is usually due
to a renal disorder. Usually, no symptoms develop unless hypertension is severe or long-
standing. Diagnosis is by sphygmomanometry. Tests may be done to determine cause, assess
damage, and identify other cardiovascular risk factors. Treatment involves lifestyle changes and
drugs, including diuretics,

    Question: "How can I lower my blood pressure naturally?"

    Answer: Based on the information provided in the text, here are some natural ways to lower your blood pressure:

    1. Lose weight: Excess weight gain can lead to increased blood pressure, so losing weight through a healthy diet and regular exercise can help lower your blood pressure naturally.

    2. Exercise regularly: Regular physical activity can help lower your blood pressure by making your heart stronger and more efficient.

    3. Eat a healthy diet: Consuming a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products can help lower your blood pressure naturally.

    4. Reduce sodium intake: Consuming too much sodium can raise your blood pressure, so reducing your sodium intake can help lower your blood pressure naturally.

    5. Limit alcohol consumption: Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure, so limiting your alcohol consumption can help lower your blood pressure naturally.

    6. Manage stress: Stress can raise your blood pressure, so finding ways to manage stress, such as through meditation or deep breathing exercises, can help lower your blood pressure naturally.

    7. Get enough sleep: Not getting enough sleep can raise your blood pressure, so getting enough sleep each night can help lower your blood pressure naturally.

    8. Increase potassium intake: Potassium can help lower your blood pressure by balancing out the effects of sodium in your body. You can increase your potassium intake through foods like bananas, leafy greens, and sweet potatoes.

    Chapter 338. Exercise and Sports Injury
Introduction
Regular exercise enhances health and a sense of well-being. However, injury, particularly over-use injury,
is a risk for people who exercise regularly. (For musculoskeletal injuries not particularly associated with
sports, see p.
3201
.)
Exercise
Exercise stimulates tissue change and adaptation, whereas rest and recovery allow such change and
adaptation to occur. Recovery from exercise is as important as the exercise stimulus. Regular physical
activity decreases the incidence of the major causes of death, improves functional status for sports and
activities of daily living, and protects against injury. Specific exercise programs are also commonly

At least 75% of people age > 65 yr do not exercise at recommended levels, despite the known health
benefits:
• Longer survival
• Improved quality of life (eg, endurance, strength, mood, flexibility, possibly cognitive function)
Exercise has proven benefits when begun as old as 75 yr. Because of the effects of aging and age-
related disorders, the relative benefits of exercise may even be greater in the elderly (see also
Sidebar
307-1
 on p.
3073
). In addition, exercise is one of the safest ways to improve health.
The largest health benefits occur, particularly with aerobic exercise, when changing from being sedentary
to exercising. Progressively less benefit occurs as the intensity of exercise increases.

recommendation). About 35 to 45% participate in minimal exercise. The elderly tend to exercise less than
other age groups for many reasons, most commonly because disorders limit their physical activity.
The benefits of exercise for the elderly are many and far exceed its risks (eg, falls, torn ligaments, pulled
muscles). Benefits include
• Reduced mortality rates, even for smokers and the obese
• Preservation of skeletal muscle strength, aerobic capacity, and bone density, contributing to mobility and
independence
• Reduced risk of obesity
• Prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disorders (including rehabilitation after MI), diabetes,
osteoporosis, colon cancer, and psychiatric disorders (especially mood disorders)

osteoporosis, colon cancer, and psychiatric disorders (especially mood disorders)
• Prevention of falls and fall-related injuries by improving muscle strength, balance, coordination, joint
function, and endurance
• Improved functional ability
• Opportunities for social interaction
• Enhanced sense of well-being
• Possibly improved sleep quality
Exercise is one of the few interventions that can restore physiologic capacity after it has been lost.
All elderly patients starting an exercise program should be screened (by interview or questionnaire) to
identify those with chronic disorders and to determine an appropriate exercise program (see p.
3295
).
Exercise is inappropriate for only a few elderly people (eg, those with unstable medical conditions).

prescribed to rehabilitate patients after MI, major surgery, and musculoskeletal injury. Regardless of
indication, recommendations for exercise should be based on 2 principles:
• Goals for activity should be specific to the patient, accounting for motivation, needs, physical ability, and
psychology, to maximize the likelihood of patient participation and desired outcome.
• Activity should be prescribed in a proper dose to achieve a desired effect. An exercise stimulus should
be sufficient for the body to adapt to a higher state of function but not so great that it causes injury.
More activity is not always better; too little or too much activity may prevent achievement of desired
outcomes.

Whether those with chronic disorders need a complete preexercise medical examination depends on tests
that have already been done and on clinical judgment. Some experts recommend such an examination,
possibly with an exercise stress test, for patients who have ≥ 2 cardiac risk factors (eg, hypertension,
obesity).
Exercise programs may include any combination of 4 types of exercise: endurance, muscle strengthening,
balance training (eg, tai chi), and flexibility (see p.
3292
). The combination of exercises recommended
depends on the patient's medical condition and fitness level. For example, a seated exercise program that
uses cuff weights for strength training and repeated movements for endurance training may be useful for

    Question: "What are the health benefits of regular exercise?"

    Answer: "Regular exercise has numerous health benefits, including reduced mortality rates, preserved skeletal muscle strength and aerobic capacity, reduced risk of obesity, prevention and treatment of various diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, osteoporosis, colon cancer, and psychiatric disorders, improved functional ability, opportunities for social interaction, enhanced sense of well-being, and possibly improved sleep quality."

    Less often, the cause is a central vestibular disorder (most commonly migraine), a disorder with a more
global effect on cerebral function, a psychiatric disorder, or a disorder affecting visual or proprioceptive
input. Sometimes, no cause can be found.
The
most common causes of dizziness without vertigo
 are less clear cut, but they are usually not

• Drug effects
• Multifactorial or idiopathic
Nonneurologic disorders with a more global effect on cerebral function sometimes manifest as dizziness
and rarely as vertigo. These disorders typically involve inadequate substrate (eg, O

, glucose) delivery
caused by hypotension, hypoxemia, anemia, or hypoglycemia; when severe, some of these disorders may

Other symptoms:
 Other, rare forms of migraine can cause other symptoms. Basilar artery migraine
causes combinations of vertigo, ataxia, visual field loss, sensory disturbances, focal weakness, and
altered level of consciousness. Hemiplegic migraine, which may be sporadic or familial, causes unilateral
weakness.
Diagnosis
• Clinical evaluation
Diagnosis is based on characteristic symptoms and a normal physical examination, which includes a
thorough neurologic examination.
Red flag findings include the following:
• Pain that reaches peak intensity within a few seconds or less (thunderclap headache)
• Onset after age 50
• Headaches that increase in intensity or frequency for weeks or longer
• History of cancer (brain metastases) or an immunosuppressive disorder (eg, HIV infection, AIDS)

caused by hypotension, hypoxemia, anemia, or hypoglycemia; when severe, some of these disorders may
manifest as syncope. Additionally, certain hormonal changes (eg, as with thyroid disease, menstruation,
pregnancy) can cause dizziness. Numerous CNS-active drugs can cause dizziness independent of any
toxic effect on the vestibular system.
Occasionally, dizziness and vertigo may be psychogenic. Patients with panic disorder, hyperventilation
syndrome, anxiety, or depression may present with complaints of dizziness.
In elderly patients, dizziness is often multifactorial secondary to drug adverse effects and age-diminished
visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive abilities. Two of the most common specific causes are disorders of

Dizziness and Vertigo
Dizziness
 is an imprecise term patients often use to describe various related sensations, including
• Faintness (a feeling of impending syncope)
• Light-headedness
• Feeling of imbalance or unsteadiness
• A vague spaced-out or swimmy-headed feeling
Vertigo
 is a false sensation of movement of the self or the environment. Usually the perceived movement
is rotary—a spinning or wheeling sensation—but some patients simply feel pulled to one side. Vertigo is
not a diagnosis—it is a description of a sensation.
Both sensations may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting or difficulty with balance, gait, or both.

Etiology
There are numerous structural (trauma, tumors, degenerative), vascular, infectious, toxic (including drug-
related), and idiopathic causes (see

), but only about 5% of cases are caused by a serious disorder.

• Triggers and relievers (ie, triggered by head/body position change)
• Associated aural symptoms (eg, hearing loss, ear fullness, tinnitus)
• Severity and related disability
Is the patient having a single, sudden, acute event, or has dizziness been chronic and recurrent? Was the
first episode the most severe (vestibular crisis)? How long do episodes last, and what seems to trigger

    Question: "I've been having headaches and dizziness lately, what could be causing this?"

    Answer: "Well, there are many possible causes of headaches and dizziness, such as migraines, inner ear problems, and medication side effects. It's important to rule out any serious underlying conditions first. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Are they constant or do they come and go? Do you experience any other symptoms like nausea, hearing loss, or vision problems? And have you noticed any triggers or patterns that seem to bring on these symptoms?"

History and physical examination are adequate for diagnosing many skin lesions. Some require biopsy or
other testing.
Important information to obtain from history includes
• Personal or family history of atopy (suggesting atopic dermatitis)
• Occupational exposures (contact dermatitis)
• Long-term exposure to sunlight or other forms of radiation (benign and malignant skin tumors)
• Systemic disease (diabetes and

exposure, such as linear streaking on an arm or leg (eg, from brushing against poison ivy) or
circumferential erythema (under a wristwatch or waistband). Any surface may be involved, but hands are
the most common surface due to handling and touching potential allergens. With airborne exposure (eg,

perfume aerosols), areas not covered by clothing are predominantly affected. The dermatitis is typically
limited to the site of contact but may later spread due to scratching and autoeczematization. In
systemically induced ACD, skin changes may be distributed over the entire body.
Diagnosis
• Clinical evaluation
• Sometimes patch testing
CD can often be diagnosed by skin changes and exposure history. The patient's occupation, hobbies,

syphilis is usually preceded by a chancre, with systemic symptoms developing 4 to 10 wk later.
Fever and rash have many infectious and drug causes. Petechial or purpuric rash is of particular concern;
it suggests possible meningococcemia, Rocky Mountain spotted fever (particularly if the palms or soles
are involved), and, less commonly, some viral infections (eg, dengue fever, hemorrhagic fevers). Other
suggestive skin lesions include the classic erythema migrans rash of Lyme disease, target lesions of
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and the painful, tender erythema of cellulitis and other bacterial soft-tissue
infections. The possibility of delayed drug hypersensitivity (even after long periods of use) should be kept
in mind.

    Question: "I noticed a rash on my arm that's been spreading. What should I do?"

    Answer: "Sorry to hear that! Based on your description, it sounds like you might have allergic contact dermatitis. It's important to tell me about any potential allergens you've been exposed to recently, such as new laundry detergent or soaps, new foods, or recent infections. Also, let me know if you've had any recent travel or exposure to potential allergens. We'll need to take a thorough history and perform a physical examination to determine the cause of your rash."

because the risk of GI adverse effects is lower; others limit coxib use to patients predisposed to GI
adverse effects (eg, the elderly, patients taking corticosteroids, those with a history of peptic ulcer
disease or GI upset due to other NSAIDs) and those who are not doing well with nonselective NSAIDs or
who have a history of intolerance to them. Although data are still limited, the prothrombotic risk suggests
that all NSAIDs should be used cautiously in patients with clinically significant atherosclerosis or multiple

increase risk of MI, stroke, and claudication. This effect appears to be drug-related, as well as dose- and
duration-related. Although there is some evidence that the risk is very low with some of the nonselective
COX inhibitors (eg, ibuprofen, naproxen) and coxibs (celecoxib), it is prudent to consider the potential for
prothrombotic effects as a risk of all NSAID therapy.
If an NSAID is likely to be used only short-term, significant adverse effects are unlikely, regardless of the
drug used. Some clinicians use a coxib first whenever therapy is likely to be long-term (eg, months)The Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition

The reason may be aspirin resistance; assays to detect lack of thromboxane suppression (indicated by
elevated urinary 11-dehydro thromboxane B

) are being studied for clinical use. Some evidence suggests
that ibuprofen can interfere with aspirin's antithrombotic effect, so other NSAIDs are recommended for
patients taking aspirin for prevention. However, all NSAIDs, some more than others, including COX-2
selective inhibitors (eg, rofecoxib), appear to increase cardiovascular risks.
Clopidogrel (usually 75 mg/day) is substituted for aspirin when ischemic events recur in patients taking

many parts of the body (ie, they protect gastric mucosa and inhibit platelet adhesiveness). Other
prostaglandins are induced by inflammation and are produced by COX-2. Selective COX-2 inhibitors, also
called coxibs (eg, celecoxib), seem to have efficacy comparable to nonselective NSAIDs and are less
likely to cause GI toxicity; however, they do not seem less likely to cause renal toxicity.
NSAIDs other than coxibs should be avoided in patients with previous peptic ulcer disease or dyspepsia.
Other possible adverse effects of all NSAIDs include headache, confusion and other CNS symptoms,
increased BP, worsening of hypertension, edema, and decreased platelet function. The effect of NSAIDs

    Question: "Can you tell me about the side effects of ibuprofen?"

    Answer: Ibuprofen is generally safe when taken as directed, but like all medications, it can have side effects. Common side effects of ibuprofen include:

    • Nausea and vomiting
    • Stomach upset and heartburn
    • Diarrhea and constipation
    • Headache and dizziness
    • Fatigue and ringing in the ears

    Less common side effects of ibuprofen can include:

    • Ulcers and bleeding in the stomach and intestines
    • Kidney problems and failure
    • High blood pressure
    • Liver damage and failure
    • Seizures and coma

    It's important to note that ibuprofen can interact with certain medications, such as blood thinners, and can exacerbate certain medical conditions, such as kidney disease, liver disease, and heart disease. If you have any of these conditions or are taking any medications, it's important to talk to your doctor before taking ibuprofen. Additionally, it's important to follow the recommended dosage and take ibuprofen with food to minimize the risk of stomach upset.

). Terms that describe the age of onset (juvenile or adult) or type of treatment (insulin- or non-
insulin-dependent) are no longer accurate because of overlap in age groups and treatments between
disease types.
Impaired glucose regulation (impaired glucose tolerance, or impaired fasting glucose—see
Table 99-2
) is an intermediate, possibly transitional, state between normal glucose metabolism and DM

symptoms (eg, young children).
Key elements for all patients are patient education, dietary and exercise counseling, and monitoring of
glucose control.
All patients with type 1 DM require insulin.
Patients with type 2 DM and mildly elevated plasma glucose should be prescribed a trial of diet and
exercise, followed by a single oral antihyperglycemic drug if lifestyle changes are insufficient, additional
oral drugs as needed (combination therapy), and insulin when ≥ 2 drugs are ineffective for meeting
recommended goals.
Patients with type 2 DM and more significant glucose elevations at diagnosis are typically prescribed
lifestyle changes and oral antihyperglycemic drugs simultaneously.
Insulin is indicated as initial therapy for women with type 2 DM who are pregnant and for patients who

guidelines and protocols. Several disease management programs have been developed:
• Disease-specific care management: A specially trained nurse, working with a primary care physician or
geriatrician, coordinates protocol-driven care, arranges support services, and teaches patients.
• Chronic care clinics: Patients with the same chronic disease are taught in groups and are visited by a
health care practitioner; this approach can help patients with diabetes achieve better glucose control.
• Specialists: Patients with a chronic disease that is difficult to stabilize can be referred to a specialist.
This approach works best when the specialist and primary care physician work collaboratively.

Because of insulin resistance, some patients with type 2 DM require very large doses (> 2 units/kg/day).
A common complication is weight gain, which is mostly attributable to reduction in loss of glucose in urine
and improved metabolic efficiency.

    Question: "What are the latest treatments available for type 2 diabetes?"

    Answer: The latest treatments available for type 2 diabetes include lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise, as well as medications like metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. In addition, new classes of medications such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors have become available in recent years. These newer medications offer improved glycemic control and weight loss benefits, but also come with potential side effects and risks. It is important for healthcare providers to individualize treatment plans based on patient factors such as severity of hyperglycemia, presence of comorbidities, and patient preferences.

    therapy is recommended for children > 8 yr and with either of the following:
• Poor response to dietary therapy, LDL cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dL, and no family history of premature
cardiovascular disease
• LDL cholesterol ≥ 160 mg/dL and a family history of premature cardiovascular disease or ≥ 2 risk factors
for premature cardiovascular disease
Childhood risk factors besides family history and diabetes include cigarette smoking, hypertension, low
HDL cholesterol (< 35 mg/dL), obesity, and physical inactivity.
Treatment options to lower LDL cholesterol in all age groups include lifestyle changes (diet and exercise),
drugs, dietary supplements, procedural interventions, and experimental therapies. Many of these options

are also effective for treating other lipid abnormalities. Exercise lowers LDL cholesterol in some people; it
is also essential to maintain ideal body weight. Dietary changes and exercise should be the initial
approach whenever feasible.
Lifestyle changes
 can involve diet and exercise. Dietary changes include decreasing intake of saturated
fats and cholesterol; increasing the proportion of dietary fiber, and complex carbohydrates; and
maintaining ideal body weight. Referral to a dietitian is often useful, especially for older people. The

General principles:
 Treatment is indicated for all patients with cardiovascular disease (secondary
prevention) and for some without (primary prevention). The National Institutes of Health's National
Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII) guidelines are the most common
reference for deciding which adults should be treated (see
Tables 100-4
 and
100-5
). The guidelines focus primarily on reducing elevated LDL cholesterol levels and secondarily on
treating high TGs, low HDL, and metabolic syndrome (see p.
64
). An alternate treatment guide (the
Sheffield table) uses TC:HDL ratios combined with presence of CAD risk factors to predict cardiovascular

ATPIII guidelines recommend that these patients have LDL cholesterol levels lowered to < 100 mg/dL, but
accumulating evidence
[
Table 100-5.
 Ncep Adult Treatment Panel III Guidelines for Treatment of Hyperlipidemia]
suggests that this target may be too high and a target LDL cholesterol < 70 mg/dL is an option for
patients at very high risk (eg, patients with known CAD and diabetes, other poorly controlled risk factors,
metabolic syndrome, or acute coronary syndrome). When drugs are used, a dose providing at least a 30
to 40% decrease in LDL cholesterol is desirable (see
Table 100-8
).
For
children
, the AAP recommends dietary treatment for children with LDL cholesterol > 110 mg/dL. Drug
therapy is recommended for children > 8 yr and with either of the following:

Indications for screening patients < 20 yr are atherosclerotic risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension,
cigarette smoking, and obesity; premature CAD in a parent, grandparent, or sibling; or a cholesterol level
> 240 mg/dL (> 6.2 mmol/L) or known dyslipidemia in a parent. If information on relatives is unavailable,
as in the case of adopted children, screening is at the discretion of the health care practitioner.
Patients with an extensive family history of heart disease should also be screened by measuring Lp(a)
levels.
Treatment
• Risk assessment by explicit criteria
• Lifestyle changes (eg, exercise, dietary modification)
• For high LDL cholesterol, statins, sometimes bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe, and other measures

cholesterol levels benefit from achieving still lower levels. Consequently, there are no
numeric definitions of dyslipidemia; the term is applied to lipid levels for which treatment has proved
beneficial. Proof of benefit is strongest for lowering elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels. In the
overall population, evidence is less strong for a benefit from lowering elevated TG and increasing low
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, in part because elevated TG and low HDL levels are more
predictive of cardiovascular risk in women than in men.
HDL levels do not always predict cardiovascular risk. For example, high HDL levels caused by some
genetic disorders may not protect against cardiovascular disorders, and low HDL levels caused by some

    Prognosis
Untreated, obesity tends to progress. The probability and severity of complications are proportional to the
absolute amount of fat, the distribution of the fat, and absolute muscle mass. After weight loss, most
people return to their pretreatment weight within 5 yr, and
[
Table 6-2.
 Body Mass Index (BMI)]
accordingly, obesity requires a lifelong management program similar to that for any other chronic disorder.
Treatment
• Nutrition management
• Physical activity
• Behavioral therapy
• Drugs (eg, sibutramine, orlistat)
• Bariatric surgery
Weight loss of even 5 to 10% improves overall health and well-being and in particular helps reduce risk of
cardiovascular disorders and type 2 diabetes. Weight loss can lead to improvement in patients with

• Between 6 mo and 5 yr: 25%
• After 6 yr: > 50%
• During adolescence if a parent is obese: > 80%
In children, preventing further weight gain, rather than losing weight, is a reasonable goal. Diet should be
modified, and physical activity increased. Increasing general activities and play is more likely to be
effective than a structured exercise program. Participating in physical activities during childhood may
promote a lifelong physically active lifestyle. Drugs and surgery are avoided but, if complications of
obesity are life threatening, may be warranted.
Measures that control weight and prevent obesity in children may benefit public health the most. Such
measures should be implemented in the family, schools, and primary care programs.

outcomes.
A prescription for exercise should specify intensity (level of exertion), volume (amount of activity in a
session), frequency (number of exercise sessions), and progressive overload (either the amount of
increase in one or more of these elements over time, or the actual load). The balance of these elements
depends on individual tolerance and physiologic principles (ie, as intensity increases, volume and
frequency may need to decrease, whereas as volume increases, intensity may need to decrease).
Intensity, volume, and frequency can be increased concurrently but only to a point because human
tolerance to strain is finite. The objective is to discover the appropriate amount of exercise for optimal

prescribed to rehabilitate patients after MI, major surgery, and musculoskeletal injury. Regardless of
indication, recommendations for exercise should be based on 2 principles:
• Goals for activity should be specific to the patient, accounting for motivation, needs, physical ability, and
psychology, to maximize the likelihood of patient participation and desired outcome.
• Activity should be prescribed in a proper dose to achieve a desired effect. An exercise stimulus should
be sufficient for the body to adapt to a higher state of function but not so great that it causes injury.
More activity is not always better; too little or too much activity may prevent achievement of desired
outcomes.

patients resume previous poor eating habits. Diets of < 1200 kcal/day cannot be sustained, but such diets
are sometimes needed to achieve rapid short-term weight loss (eg, to prepare for surgery, to lessen
obstructive sleep apnea). Diets of < 800 kcal/day do not produce greater weight loss and are less well
tolerated.
Physical activity:
 Exercise increases energy expenditure, BMR, and diet-induced thermogenesis.
Exercise also seems to regulate appetite to more closely match caloric needs. Other benefits include
• Increased insulin sensitivity
• Improved lipid profile
• Lower BP
• Better aerobic fitnessThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition
Chapter 6. Obesity & the Metabolic Syndrome
112

• Eating slowly
• Substituting a physically active hobby for a passive one
Social support, cognitive therapy, and stress management may help, particularly during the lapses usually
experienced during any long-term weight loss program. Self-monitoring is useful, and maintenance of a
diet diary is particularly effective.
Drugs:
 Drugs may be used if BMI is > 30 or if BMI is > 27 and patients have complications (eg,
hypertension, insulin resistance). Most weight loss due to drug treatment is modest (5 to 10%) at best and
occurs during the first 6 mo; not all patients benefit. Drugs are more useful for maintaining weight loss but
must be continued indefinitely for weight loss to be maintained. Premenopausal women taking
systemically acting drugs for weight control should use contraception.

    Question: "Can you suggest a beginner's workout plan for weight loss?"

    Answer: "For beginners, I would recommend starting with moderate-intensity exercise for 30 minutes per day, 5 days a week. This could include brisk walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming. Additionally, incorporating strength training exercises 2-3 times per week can help build muscle and boost metabolism. It's important to remember to listen to your body and start slow, gradually increasing the duration and intensity of your workouts as you become more comfortable."

    Answer in the same language the question was asked.
    Use only the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

    People with known hypersensitivity to stings should carry a kit containing a prefilled syringe of
epinephrine. They should use it as soon as possible after a sting and seek medical care immediately.
People who have a history of anaphylaxis or a known allergy to insect bites should wear identification
such as an alert bracelet.
Prevention
People who have had anaphylaxis are at risk from subsequent stings. Desensitization immunotherapy can
be considered. Venom immunotherapy (see also p.
1116
) is highly effective, reducing the chance of
recurrent anaphylaxis from 50% to about 10% after 2 yr of therapy and to about 2% after 3 to 5 yr of
therapy. Children who receive venom immunotherapy have a significantly lower risk of systemic reaction

Diagnosis is clinical. Apid stings are checked for the stinger. Upper and lower airways are assessed for
signs of allergic reaction. Secondary bacterial cellulitis is rare but is considered when erythema and
swelling begin a day or two after the sting (rather than immediately) and pain is significant.
Treatment
• Parenteral epinephrine and antihistamines for systemic allergic reactions
• Removal of any apid stingers
• Analgesics and antihistamines for local reactions
Stingers, if present, should be removed as quickly as possible. Suggested methods include scraping with
a thin dull edge (eg, edge of a credit card, dull side of a scalpel, thin table knife).
Pain, burning, and itching can be reduced by placing an ice cube over the sting as soon as possible and

 blockers, NSAIDs, or both. Other possibly effective local measures include antihistamine
lotion (eg, with diphenhydramine or tripelennamine), lidocaine patches, eutectic mixture of local
anesthetic cream, intradermal injection of 1% lidocaine (with or without 1:100,000 epinephrine), and mid-
potency corticosteroid creams or ointments (eg, triamcinolone 0.1%). Most folk remedies (eg, application
of meat tenderizer) are of limited effectiveness.
Allergic reactions are treated with IV antihistamines; anaphylaxis is treated with parenteral epinephrine
and IV fluids and vasopressors if necessary (see p.
1121

People with known hypersensitivity to stings should carry a kit containing a prefilled syringe of

 should include a detailed account of the individual episodes of
urticaria, including distribution, size, and appearance of lesions; frequency of occurrence; duration of
individual lesions; and any prior episodes. Activities and exposures during, immediately before, and within
the past 24 h of the appearance of urticaria should be noted. Clinicians specifically should ask about
recent exercise; exposure to potential allergens (see
Table 71-3
), insects, or animals; new laundry
detergent or soaps; new foods; recent infections; or recent stressful life events. The patient should be
asked about the duration between any suspected trigger and the appearance of urticaria and which

 Nuts and seafood
Cross-reactivity between food and nonfood allergens exists, and sensitization may occur nonenterally. For
example, patients with oral allergies (typically, pruritus, erythema, and edema of the mouth when fruits
and vegetables are eaten) may have been sensitized by pollen exposure; children with peanut allergy
may have been sensitized by topical creams containing peanut oil used to treat rashes. Many patients
who are allergic to latex are also allergic to bananas, kiwis, avocadoes, or a combination.
In general, food allergy is mediated by IgE, T cells, or both. IgE-mediated allergy (eg, urticaria, asthma,

    Question: "What should I do if I think I'm having an allergic reaction to a bee sting?"

    Answer: If you think you're having an allergic reaction to a bee sting, you should seek medical attention immediately. You should remove any remaining stingers and use an EpiPen or other epinephrine injector if you have one. You should also take antihistamines and hydrocortisone cream to reduce swelling and itching. It is important to note that people with known hypersensitivity to stings should carry a kit containing a prefilled syringe of epinephrine and wear identification such as an alert bracelet. Additionally, desensitization immunotherapy can be considered for those who have had anaphylaxis.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an organized, sequential response to cardiac arrest, including

Recognition of absent breathing and circulation
• Basic life support with chest compressions and rescue breathing
• Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) with definitive airway and rhythm control
• Postresuscitative care

attractive and heroic, these measures are not routinely available, and they are not commonly used in
most hospitals.
CPR is not done if patients have a perfusing rhythm, even if pulses are not palpable. Fluids are given,
and active rewarming is done. Hypotension and bradycardia are expected when core temperature is low
and, if due solely to hypothermia, need not be aggressively treated. Patients with a nonperfusing rhythm
require cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Chest compressions and endotracheal intubation are done.
Defibrillation is difficult if body temperature is low; one attempt may be made, but if ineffective, further

tamponade, tension pneumothorax, or massive pulmonary embolus. Unfortunately, many causes are not
identified during CPR. Clinical examination, chest ultrasonography, and chest x-ray can detect tension
pneumothorax. Cardiac ultrasonography can detect cardiac contractions and recognize cardiac
tamponade, extreme hypovolemia (empty heart), right ventricular overload suggesting pulmonary
embolism, and focal wall motion abnormalities suggesting MI.
Prognosis
Survival to hospital discharge, particularly neurologically intact survival, is a more meaningful outcome
than simply return of spontaneous circulation.
Survival rates vary significantly; favorable factors include
• Witnessed arrest
• In-hospital location (particularly a monitored unit)
• Early and effective bystander-initiated CPR

in case of emergency and see an intact identifier, they will provide comfort care only and not attempt
resuscitation. These protocols are important to know because normally, emergency medical technicians
are not expected to read or rely upon a living will or durable power of attorney for health care.
A DNR order does not mean "do not treat." Rather, it means only that CPR will not be done. Other
treatments (eg, antibiotic therapy, transfusions, dialysis, use of a ventilator) that may prolong life can still
be provided. CPR itself usually does not result in long-term, neurologically intact survival, but other

members should know how to do CPR.

Contributing disorders (eg, anemia, heart failure) are aggressively treated.
The care unit should be a quiet, calm, restful area. Single rooms are preferred; privacy consistent with
monitoring should be ensured. Usually, visitors and telephone calls are restricted to family members

prevent a sense of isolation, as can access to a radio, television, and newspaper.

Caregiver assistance:
 Immediate family members are largely responsible for care of a patient with
dementia. Nurses and social workers can teach them and other caregivers how to best meet the patient's
needs (eg, how to deal with daily care and handle financial issues); teaching should be ongoing. Other
resources (eg, support groups, educational materials, Internet web sites) are available.
Caregivers may experience substantial stress. Stress may be caused by worry about protecting the
patient and by frustration, exhaustion, anger, and resentment from having to do so much to care for
someone. Health care practitioners should watch for early symptoms of caregiver stress and burnout and,

Most meditation practices were developed in a religious or spiritual context; their ultimate goal was some
type of spiritual growth, personal transformation, or transcendental experience. However, studies suggest
that as a health care intervention, meditation can often be beneficial regardless of a person's cultural or
religious background.
Uses:
 Meditation has been used to relieve anxiety, pain, depression, stress, insomnia, and symptoms of

financial resources are adequate but basic needs are not being met, the examiner should determine why.
Assessing these resources can also help identify risk factors for abuse (eg, financial stress, financial
exploitation of the patient).
In the interview with the family caregiver, confrontation should be avoided. The interviewer should explore
whether caregiving responsibilities are burdensome for the family member and, if appropriate,
acknowledge the caregiver's difficult role. The caregiver is asked about recent stressful events (eg,
bereavement, financial stresses), the patient's illness (eg, care needs, prognosis), and the reported cause
of any recent injuries.

Stress testing is used for diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) and for risk stratification and
monitoring of patients with known CAD. In patients with CAD, a blood supply that is adequate at rest may
be inadequate when cardiac demands are increased by exercise or other forms of stress. Stress testing is

    cause depression
Diagnosis is based on identifying the symptoms and signs (see p.
1539
). Several brief questionnaires are
available for screening. They help elicit some depressive symptoms but cannot be used alone for
diagnosis. Specific close-ended questions help determine whether patients have symptoms required by
DSM-IV-TR criteria for diagnosis of major depression.
Severity is determined by the degree of pain and disability (physical, social, occupational) and by duration
of symptoms. A physician should gently but directly ask patients about any thoughts and plans to harm
themselves or others (see p.
1579
). Psychosis and catatonia indicate severe depression. Melancholic
features indicate severe or moderate depression. Coexisting physical conditions, substance abuse

Depression may reduce protective immune responses. Depression increases risk of cardiovascular
disorders, MIs, and stroke, perhaps because in depression, cytokines and factors that increase blood
clotting are elevated and heart rate variability is decreased—all potential risk factors for cardiovascular
disorders.
Major depression (unipolar disorder):
 Periods (episodes) that include ≥ 5 mental or physical
symptoms and last ≥ 2 wk are classified as major depression. One of the symptoms must be sadness
deep enough to be described as despondency or despair (often called depressed mood) or loss of
interest or pleasure in usual activities (anhedonia). Other mental symptoms include feelings of
worthlessness or guilt, recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, and a reduced ability to concentrate.

behavior (see p.
3060
). While depressed, children and adolescents tend to fall far behind academically
and lose important peer relationships. Untreated, major depression may remit in 6 to 12 mo, but
recurrences are common.
Diagnosis
• Clinical evaluation
Diagnosis is based on symptoms and signs. A careful review of the history and appropriate laboratory
tests are needed to exclude other disorders (eg, infectious mononucleosis, thyroid disorders, drug
abuse). History should include causative factors such as domestic violence, sexual abuse and
exploitation, and drug adverse effects. Questions about suicidal behavior (eg, ideation, gestures,
attempts) should be asked.
Other mental disorders that can cause depressive symptoms (eg, anxiety, bipolar disorders) must be

enough to interfere with functioning or cause considerable distress. Decreased interest or
pleasure in activities may be as apparent as or even more apparent than mood abnormalities.
Diagnosis is by history and examination. Treatment is with antidepressants, psychotherapy, or
both.
Major depression occurs in as many as 2% of children and 5% of adolescents. Rates for other
depressive disorders are unknown. The exact cause of depression in children and adolescents is
unknown, but in adults, it is believed to result from interactions of genetically determined risk factors and
environmental stress (particularly deprivation and loss early in life).
Symptoms and Signs
Basic manifestations are similar to those in adults but are related to typical concerns of children, such as

schoolwork and play. Children may be unable to explain inner feelings or moods. Depression should be
considered when previously well-performing children do poorly in school, withdraw from society, or
commit delinquent acts.
Common symptoms include
• A sad appearance
• Excessive irritability
• Apathy and withdrawal
• Reduced capacity for pleasure (often expressed as profound boredom)
• Feeling rejected and unloved
• Somatic complaints (eg, headaches, abdominal pain, insomnia)
• Persistent self-blame
In some children with major depressive disorder, the predominant mood is irritability rather than sadness
(an important difference between childhood and adult forms).
Other symptoms include anorexia, weight loss (or failure to achieve expected weight gain), sleep

depression? General appearance may provide clues as well. For example, is the patient clean and well-
kept? Is a tremor or facial droop present?
Mental Status Examination
A mental status examination uses observation and questions to evaluate several domains
[
Table 157-1.
 Areas to Cover in the Initial Psychiatric Assessment]
of mental function, including speech, emotional expression, thinking and perception, and cognitive
functions. Brief standardized screening questionnaires are available for assessing certain components of
the mental status examination, including those specifically designed to assess orientation and memory.
However, screening questionnaires cannot take the place of a broader, more detailed mental status
examination (see
Sidebar 168-1
 on p.
1588
).
General appearance

    Question: "What are signs of depression to look out for?"

    Answer: "Signs of depression to look out for include a sad appearance, excessive irritability, apathy and withdrawal, reduced capacity for pleasure, feeling rejected and unloved, somatic complaints, persistent self-blame, and anorexia or weight loss."

Introduction
Joint disorders may be inflammatory (RA, spondyloarthropathies, crystal-induced arthritis) or relatively
less inflammatory (osteoarthritis, neurogenic arthropathy). Crystal-induced arthritis and infectious arthritis
are discussed elsewhere in THE MANUAL.
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that primarily involves the
joints. RA causes damage mediated by cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteases.
Characteristically, peripheral joints (eg, wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints) are symmetrically
inflamed, leading to progressive destruction of articular structures, usually accompanied by
systemic symptoms. Diagnosis is based on specific clinical, laboratory, and imaging features.

disease.
Sarcoidosis, Whipple's disease, multicentric reticulohistiocytosis, and other systemic diseases may
involve joints; other clinical features and tissue biopsy sometimes help differentiate these conditions.
Acute rheumatic fever has a migratory pattern of joint involvement and evidence of antecedent
streptococcal infection (culture or changing antistreptolysin-O titer); in contrast, RA has an additive
arthritis.
Reactive arthritis (see p.
343
) can be differentiated by antecedent GI or GU symptoms; asymmetric
involvement and pain at the Achilles insertion of the heel, sacroiliac joints, and large joints of the leg;
conjunctivitis; iritis; painless buccal ulcers; balanitis circinata; or keratoderma blennorrhagicum on the
soles and elsewhere.

• Rheumatoid factor and anticitrullinated peptide (CCP) in RA
• HLA-B27 in spondyloarthropathy (occasionally useful)
• Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in certain vasculitides (occasionally useful)
Tests such as WBC count, ESR, and C-reactive protein may help determine the likelihood that arthritis is
inflammatory due to infectious or other systemic disorders, but these tests are not highly specific or
sensitive. For example, an elevated ESR or C-reactive protein level suggests inflammation or may be due
to aging or a large number of nonarticular inflammatory conditions (eg, infection, cancer). Also, such
markers may not be elevated in all inflammatory disorders.

    Question: "Can you explain what rheumatoid arthritis is?"

    Answer: Sure! Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that primarily involves the joints. It causes damage mediated by cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteases. Characteristically, peripheral joints (such as wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints) are symmetrically inflamed, leading to progressive destruction of articular structures, usually accompanied by systemic symptoms.

cardiovascular history, with questions about
• Known hypertension or heart murmur
• Chest pain
• Exercise-induced syncope, near-syncope, chest pain, or palpitations
• Family history of sudden cardiac death at age < 50 yr, arrhythmias, dilated or hypertrophic

All patients or their caregivers can complete a home safety checklist to identify hazards. Physical and
occupational therapists may visit a patient's home to assess its safety.
Prevention of Iatrogenic Complications
Iatrogenic complications are more common and may be more severe among the elderly than among
younger patients. These complications include adverse drug effects (eg, interactions), falls, nosocomial
infections, pressure ulcers, delirium, and complications related to surgery. Prevention is often possible.
Risk Factors
The first step in prevention is to identify patients at high risk. Risk factors include the following.
Multiple chronic diseases:
 The greater the number of chronic diseases, the greater the risk that

transfusion (see p.
1037
). Autologous transfusion decreases the risks of infection and transfusion
reactions. Emergency surgery also has a higher risk of morbidity and mortality.
Patient risk factors
 are stratified by some clinicians using published criteria (see
Table 349-1
). Older age is associated with decreased physiologic reserve and greater morbidity if a
complication occurs. However, chronic disorders are more closely associated with increased
postoperative morbidity and mortality than is age alone. Older age is not an absolute contraindication to
surgery.
Cardiac risk factors
 dramatically increase surgical risk. Among the most serious are the following:
• Unstable angina
• Recent MI
• Poorly controlled heart failure

• Cardiovascular disease
• Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (fatty liver)
• Gallbladder disease
• Gastroesophageal reflux
• Obstructive sleep apnea
• Reproductive system disorders
• Many cancers
• Osteoarthritis
• Social and psychologic problems
Insulin resistance, dyslipidemias, and hypertension (the metabolic syndrome) develop, often leading to
diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease (see p.
64
). These complications are more likely in patients
with fat that is concentrated abdominally, a high serum triglyceride level, a family history of type 2
diabetes mellitus or premature cardiovascular disease, or a combination of these risk factors.
Obesity is also a risk factor for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (which may lead to cirrhosis) and for

be a stronger predictor of MI in women (especially those < 45). Genetic factors play a role, and several
systemic disorders (eg, hypertension, hypothyroidism) and metabolic disorders (eg,
hyperhomocysteinemia) contribute to risk. A high level of apoprotein B (apo B) is an important risk factor;
it may identify increased risk when total cholesterol or LDL level is normal.
High blood levels of C-reactive protein indicate plaque instability and inflammation and may be a stronger
predictor of risk of ischemic events than high levels of LDL. High blood levels of triglycerides and insulin
(reflecting insulin resistance) may be risk factors, but data are less clear. CAD risk is increased by
smoking; a diet high in fat and calories and low in phytochemicals (found in fruits and vegetables), fiber,

    Question: "What are the risk factors for heart disease?"

    Answer: "Risk factors for heart disease include high blood levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and lipoprotein a, low blood levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity."

source of iron and zinc (both of which can be limited in the diet of an exclusively breastfed infant) and is
therefore a good early complementary food. Vegetarian infants can get adequate iron from iron-fortified

shielded (because pregnancy is possible). Medically necessary x-rays or other imaging should not be
postponed because of pregnancy. However, elective x-rays are postponed until after pregnancy.
Treatment
Problems identified during evaluation are managed. Women are counseled about exercise and diet, and
nutritional supplements are prescribed. What to avoid, what to expect, and when to obtain further
evaluation are explained. Couples are encouraged to attend childbirth classes.
Diet and supplements:
 To provide nutrition for the fetus, most women require about 250 kcal extra
daily; most should come from protein. If maternal weight gain is excessive (> 1.4 kg/mo during the early

Daily dietary requirements for essential nutrients also depend on age, sex, weight, and metabolic and
physical activity. Every 5 yr, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences/National
Research Council and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) issues the dietary reference intakes
(DRIs) for protein, energy, and some vitamins and minerals (see
Tables 1-4
,
4-1
, and
5-2
). For vitamins and minerals about which less is known, safe and adequate daily dietary
intakes are estimated.
Pregnant women (see p.
2608
) and infants (see p.
2703
) have special nutritional needs.
The USDA publishes the Food Guide Pyramid, which specifies the number of recommended daily
servings of various food groups. The recommendations are individualized based on age, sex, and

based on clinically suspected nonobstetric disorders (see
Table 261-4
).
Treatment
Pregnancy-induced vomiting may be relieved by drinking or eating frequently (5 or 6 small meals/day), but
only bland foods (eg, crackers, soft drinks, BRAT diet [bananas, rice, apple-sauce, dry toast]) should be
eaten. Eating before rising may help. If dehydration (eg, due to hyperemesis gravidarum) is suspected, 1
to 2 L of normal saline or Ringer's lactate is given IV, and any identified electrolyte abnormalities are
corrected.
Certain drugs (see
Table 261-6
) can be used to relieve nausea and vomiting during the 1st trimester without evidence of
adverse effects on the fetus.

Parents should be encouraged to visit and interact with the infant as much as possible within the
constraints of the infant's medical condition.
Preterm infants should be transitioned to the supine sleeping position before hospital discharge. Parents
should be instructed to keep cribs free of fluffy materials including blankets, quilts, pillows, and stuffed
toys, which have been associated with an increased risk of SIDS.
Feeding:
 Feeding should be by NGT until coordination of sucking, swallowing, and breathing is
established at about 34 wk gestation, at which time breastfeeding is strongly encouraged. Most
premature infants tolerate breast milk, which provides immunologic and nutritional factors that are absent

Environmental factors:
 Weight is gained when caloric intake exceeds energy needs. Important
determinants of energy intake include portion sizes and the energy density of the food. High-fat foods,
processed foods, and diets high in refined carbohydrates, soft drinks, fruit juices, and alcohol promote
weight gain. Diets high in fresh fruit and vegetables, fiber, and complex carbohydrates, with water as the
main fluid consumed, minimize weight gain. A sedentary lifestyle promotes weight gain.
Regulatory factors:
 Prenatal maternal obesity, prenatal maternal smoking, intrauterine growth

    Question: "What are the best foods to eat during pregnancy for fetal health?"

    Answer: "Foods rich in folic acid, iron, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids are crucial for fetal development. Examples of these foods include leafy greens like spinach and kale, citrus fruits like oranges and lemons, beans and legumes, nuts and seeds, fish like salmon and sardines, and dairy products like milk and cheese."

For pregnant women with a history of severe caries, the above regimen may be used before the child's
teeth erupt. If this is not feasible, the mother can use xylitol, as mentioned above, from the time of the
baby's birth to the age at which the mother no longer samples the child's food (the hypothesized mode of
transfer).
For prevention of caries in deciduous teeth (once they have erupted) in infants, bedtime bottles should
contain only water.
Gingivitis
Gingivitis is inflammation of the gingivae, causing bleeding with swelling, redness, exudate, a
change of normal contours, and, occasionally, discomfort. Diagnosis is based on inspection.
Treatment involves professional teeth cleaning and intensified home dental hygiene. Advanced
cases may require antibiotics or surgery.

when an infant goes to bed with a bottle (baby or nursing bottle caries). Thus, bedtime bottles should
contain only water.
The elderly often take drugs that reduce salivary flow, predisposing to caries. The elderly also have a
higher incidence of root caries because of gingival recession, exposure of root surfaces, and declining
manual dexterity.
Complications:
 Untreated caries leads to tooth destruction, infections, and the need for extractions and
replacement prostheses. Premature loss of deciduous teeth may shift the adjacent teeth, hindering
eruption of their permanent successors.
Symptoms and Signs
Caries initially involves only the enamel and causes no symptoms. A cavity that invades the dentin causes

Anatomy and Development
Teeth:
 The teeth are categorized as incisors, canines, premolars, and molars and conventionally are
numbered beginning with the maxillary right 3rd molar (see
Fig. 56-1
).
Each tooth has a crown and a root. The canines have the largest and strongest roots. An inner pulp
contains blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves, surrounded by the hard but porous dentin, a very hard
enamel coating that covers the crown. The bonelike cementum is over the root, which, when healthy, is
covered by gingiva (see
Fig. 56-2
). Twenty deciduous

drinks). The salt water is held in the mouth on the affected side until it cools and then is expectorated and
immediately replaced with another mouthful. Three or 4 glasses of salt water a day usually control
inflammation and pain pending dental evaluation.
Teething pain
 in young children may be treated with weight-based doses of acetaminophen or ibuprofen.
Topical treatments can include chewing hard crackers (eg, biscotti), applying 7.5% or 10% benzocaine
gel qid (provided there is no family history of methemoglobinemia), and chewing on anything cold (eg,
gel-containing teething rings).The Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition
